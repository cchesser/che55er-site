Documentation is a valuable means of scaling knowledge through your teams. Teams are continually challenged to do more, with less. However, making lean maintainable documentation is a challenge, especially when documentation systems are not aligned to your development toolchain. Any point of friction in maintaining your documentation increase your probability of having out-of-date and untrustworthy documentation.

In this talk, we will explore how you can start managing your documentation like code. This will walk through the history of how different companies have approached improving their internal engineering documentation and the valuable common properties that have emerged from those methods. Examples will be shared on how you can enable this type of approach within your teams using open-source projects, managing content through a simple Markdown format that can deliver rich content within a familiar developer toolchain and workflow.

If you want to improve your documentation and accelerate how your teams share their ideas, this talk is for you.
