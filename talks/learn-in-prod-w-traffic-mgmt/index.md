# Learn in Production with Traffic Management


# Abstract

Our systems are continually evolving, spurring the necessity to focus on how we can introduce changes which minimize the risk of a “big bang” event. By examining how traffic flows through your distributed systems, you can find ways of testing and evaluating gradual changes. By understanding different ways of managing your traffic, you build new options for evolving and testing your systems.

In this talk, we will cover approaches applied at Cerner Corporation when evolving their service ecosystem by leveraging different traffic management patterns. These patterns will be shared, and the lessons learned through their application. If you are interested in minimizing risk when introducing change in your systems and getting insights into your system along the way, this talk is for you!
