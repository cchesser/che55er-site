## jvmperf.net - Java Performance Workshop

An online guided workshop that explores the performance aspects of a Java project. This project was something I created in 2015 that supported a 4 hour workshop. In 2021, I have been converting it into its own website and updating the content based on all the differences that has occurred with Java in the last few years (containers, Java 11+).
