These last two days were [KCDC](https://www.kcdc.info) in Kansas City for me. This was my first in-person developer conference since late 2019. While there were still restrictions (wearing masks), it was a fantastic time to see people again. I was able to meet up with past colleagues and discover new people at lunch and through talks, an experience that immediately filled a void in my life. While I have participated in other virtual conferences since the pandemic started, the in-person session was a great experience. Everyone I talked to also shared the same feedback.

Many thanks to the organizers, sponsors, and speakers for making it happen! This post will just include some of my notes that I captured which I thought were readable enough for sharing, and references for notes on my talk that I also shared.

## Notes

I try my best to take notes throughout talks. Many times these notes help me remember and recall content, or bring forward a point that was made vocally, but maybe not obvious when seeing a slide.

## My Talk

While I attended talks, I was also a speaker on the topic of _Docs as Code_. As part of the talk, I created both a site to provide an example and resource, which [you can find here](https://cchesser.github.io/docs-as-code/).
