# Abstract

Change is something we must continually navigate. In a large organization, change can be further challenging based on the number of people that must have a shared understanding in this navigation. This can be complicated with organizational boundaries that can limit consistent communication across large groups, allowing costly variance or great ideas only surfacing within a smaller team or organizational boundary. We must improve how we stay connected, without overloading teams through more channels of communication. There must be a better way.
 
Communities of Practice can enable communication across organizational boundaries, creating a support network of knowledge when navigating change, and embraces the influence of Conwayâ€™s Law in our systems. In this talk, we will share lessons learned in this approach when applying this in medium to large organization. After this talk, you will have practical ways of improving the communication across your teams, enabling idea sharing, and navigating change with a larger community.
