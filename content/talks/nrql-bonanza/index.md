This talk was part of a New Relic User Group session in August 2023. This short talk
walks through some different examples of data you can access in New Relic ...
which you may not have known about. This can include data about your data usage 
(ingestion), your agents (version compliance), and even the queries being executed. 
This also includes ways you can explore the data dictionary or execute queries 
through NerdGraph (GraphQL).
