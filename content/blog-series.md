This is a collection of blogs that carried a similar theme, but were broken into individual posts.

## Decision Making Album

* [Decisions: The Pursuit of Options](/post/decisions-the-pursuit-of-options): A talk which I go over the challenges of technical decision making and tactics that can be applied to improve them.
* [Power of Murphy's Law](/post/power-of-murphys-law): In this blog post, I share the power (the good and bad) of Murphy's Law. We learn from failure, but we also don't want to be blinded by it...like from this fire breathing unicorn.
* [Novelty Trap](/post/novelty-trap): In this post, I share our appeal to novelty and how it can affect our technology choices. Recognize the power novelty brings to learning, but don't allow it to mask the costs of a choice.

## Email Trilogy

* [Simple Email Process](/post/simple-email-process): A simple set of notes on how I consume email.
* [Think Twice Before Emailing](/post/think-twice-before-emailing): A few guiding principles of what and when to send emails.
* [Thank You Emails](/post/thank-you-emails): A simple way of using email to thank and individual, and keeping their organizational leaders included.
