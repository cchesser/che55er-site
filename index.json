The act of measuring and analyzing how your code is performing becomes an essential activity in all phases of your development. This skill becomes even more critical once you are required to troubleshoot and evaluate your service in a unique production environment. Understanding what operations are consuming most of our CPU time, as well as, what areas of your code are wasting resources will greatly improve your ability to diagnose a sluggish JVM. In this talk, we will explore the key tools for monitoring and measuring the JVM. An overview will be provided on core concepts involving thread state and memory management operations. Examples will then be provided on what free tooling exists to crack open your JVM and profile your code to identify the slow or defective areas. This will briefly cover how you can achieve this locally, but will focus on monitoring a remote JVM (typical for production scenarios). Finally, we will briefly cover how you can further map what system level operations are being invoked from the JVM to understand what limitations it may be facing. The examples provided will be tailored to the Oracle HotSpot JVM in a Linux environment.

Without people, you don’t have an organization (excluding robots). In the world of software development, many forces get applied to the people within your team which harm or degrade their quality of life. Fixed deadlines, the presence of Murphy’s Law in production environments, compilers which don’t understand your intentions, or just dealing with humans that don’t understand your code is working as designed. Face it, software development is tough and the only way you can survive it is by sticking together. The power of camaraderie within a team, is a force that can combat many of these ever-changing external forces that can damage your team. To build camaraderie, one must invest time and effort within the team. This talk discusses how infusing humor within your team through the application of pranks can build camaraderie. An empirical study of pranks at Cerner Corporation, which has spanned more than eleven years, will be shared. In this study, you will get to hear some of the greatest pranks that have been witnessed and documented at this company. Pranks applied from entry-level engineers to some of the highest levels of leadership in our engineering organizations will be shown. From this talk, you find out the benefits of humor through the application of pranks which can give you stories and friendships that outlast any software solution you build.

As a result, we perceive meetings as a negative exercise, only hindering us from our larger goals of software creation. In this talk, we will discuss how you can optimize the event of meetings. A brief overview will be shared on the common traps that meetings can impose on our lives. Characteristics and the mathematical properties of meetings will be discussed to provide guidance on how to better organize for these events. Styles of communication and the importance of listening for both verbal and non-verbal cues will also be examined. Lastly, tools and tactics will be shared on how to reduce the total cost of meetings by minimizing the amount of time spent.

With the ever growing landscape of technology choices, we are faced with making a decision on a frequent basis. While decision making is not something we view as a core activity of engineering, it is the one thing we are doing at all levels of our architectures. This type of activity not only deserves our focus, but should also be considered as part of our craft that we pursue with improvement. This talk is a sequel to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Meetings, where we will pursue the craft of decision making. One of the most valuable products from meeting are decisions. In this talk, we walk through the important process of identifying what problem we are trying to solve and how we can make decisions that allow us to change. This will include common approaches of pattern matching of problems and understanding the boundary of both problem and solutions spaces. Furthermore, how we can learn from cognitive science on how our established pattern matching can limit our ability to see newer solutions. Finally, we will share an effective documentation approach of capturing the context around a decision, so the “why” is not lost in the choice, empowering you to always being capable to make a different decision as things change.

Through additional exposure to these larger problems that no longer could be tackled through the use of my beloved debugger, I began to see how it required different care and feeding at both the personal and team level to overcome these challenges. By investing in these areas, it would invigorate our creative process and deliver ideas that would contradict our traditional thinking. In this talk, we will explore approaches that I have found to be effective in improving your creative thinking process, bringing diverse ideas into teams, and building a culture of routine learning from different perspectives. From these approaches, we will look at ways to effectively pitch ideas to introduce change in your systems and in your teams, which can breathe life into the possibilities of different solutions to previous difficult challenges. We will also briefly cover things to combat routine costs to the team, which can give more focus on how to tackle the larger problems versus being distracted by the continuous noise that can drain your joy of programming.

We are asked to share ideas to influence change, but this can be challenging in this rapidly growing field. This requires conveying thoughts to different audiences which may also vary on their technical vocabulary. It may be easy to reference a software engineering principle or law that can elegantly describe a technical scenario, but it may be ineffective when conveyed to others who are not aware of that concept. To be effective, we realize that words matter based on our audience. In this talk, we focus on how we can improve in communicating our technical ideas across the spectrum of stakeholders in our systems. We will walk through the art of boundary spanning, where we seek to effectively communicate across different groups. This will include ways to convey ideas with different audiences and how to readjust when misunderstandings arise. We will review concise ways of sharing software engineering concepts through laws and principles, but also approaches in guiding others who may not be familiar with the term.

With working more from home, I wanted to make subtle changes in different aspects in my life. For example, I previously used to enjoy podcasts on my drive to work. Now, I focus on listening to these while I do chores around the house. In this blog post, I will share how I found an effective way of establishing a new habit through something simple which happens to have science behind it. I hope this is helpful if you are looking at ways to be effective in new habit building too. The Habit I wanted to practice drawing more. By drawing, I mean making simple cartoons. I’m not great at drawing, but I have found that the more that I do it, the better I get. Especially, when I try to draw things on the fly (i.e. when taking notes), by applying common things I have drawn before. I also found it to be a great way to allow my mind to focus on something else while building a skill (drawing). Anway, that was the habit I wanted to establish: draw more. The Approach I decided that I wanted to draw something different everyday for my kids. These would be part of their note that would be in their school lunch. I found it hard to make a new message everyday, but it seemed like a good practice in trying to draw something new. I also feel like cartoons are a universal way of communicating. A simple picture, that doesn’t require too much detail, and can itself be entertaining without any words. When deciding what to draw everyday, I wanted it to be simple. More specifically, to be approachable for me to do each day. I didn’t want to require an extensive amount of thinking, but enough where it would challenge me to come up with something new. I mean, who would want a lunch note with the same picture everyday!? 😄 Finally, I wanted to have some common elements so it was easier for me to practice the same type of drawing, but also allow it to be different. I decided that I would draw a character, that would be something different each time. These ended up having a likeness to Mr. Peanut or The California Raisins (oh, how I loved their TV specials as a kid). As a result, I would make banana man, apple man, etc. These would also include a message, but the messages didn’t vary too much, a greeting and sharing something positive about the day (“Happy Tuesday! Have a great afternoon!”). The Frequency By having the habit applied to an existing routine (school week), it was a healthy dose of doing something consistently. However, you also had a few breaks with the habit. This included weekends, holidays, and school breaks. Having some breaks known upfront, helped me practice stepping away and returning with my habit. While this was a somewhat simple task, I realized that I probably wouldn’t be the best at following it if I was expecting myself to do it every day of the year. I then found myself establishing a set time, after doing dishes, to do these drawings. Sometimes when this anchor period didn’t occur (doing dishes), I would almost forget to do the drawings, and would scramble to do them in the morning. When things would get busy, I would find myself getting quite quick at making these. This is where I felt it helped me improve in other cases, like notetaking, where I wouldn’t spend too much time on detail and would accept mediocre quality since it was understandable enough in what it was illustrating. Applying common things together for a drawing, since I was doing it often in other illustrations. Found these packed away in my kid’s bag from past lunches. The Trick What I found powerful about this habit was associating it with my children. If I didn’t do the drawing, I could visualize my kids being saddened as they open their lunch and not finding a note they were expecting from their parents. I felt obligated to do these notes. In habit building, this is often an effective tool in having accountability.

Especially as digital tooling advances and exposes multiple options in building these artful sophistications. I strongly recommend in starting with simple to the box and arrow diagrams. Avoid trying to convey through additional types of icons when initially communicating your ideas. Architecture of our systems is illustrated through their relationships of entities, which can be achieved through these two simple elements (boxes and arrows). The simplicity and versatility of the box and arrow diagram is something I think we occasionally associate as a weaker form of communication. It looks so basic, it feels like it doesn’t bring any significant value over a verbal description. However, I would argue that an image, as basic as it may be, becomes a central point when describing something. By leading with this simple illustration, you aren’t over investing in some time intensive diagram, as you can do this with just pen and paper and take a photo of it. No fancy software required! Box and arrows are a simple, universal way of expressing a system and brings a visual aide at a low cost when initially discussing an idea. Note: Without even knowing what these boxes represent, you can see flow and how E is a critical dependency. Try describing this in written or verbal form to someone else, and see how much more effort it takes to just convey this elementary set of relationships. You will find that the audience tries to draw this same picture in their head to render what is being described.

This is where additional symbols can be of assistance. When seeking to add different symbols, consider using universal symbols. By universal, I mean they are well-known and do not vary in their interpretation. For example, a smile can indicate something that is good and happy or a fire can indicate destruction. Universal symbols are well within reach to use, but I find we often don’t leverage them in our own illustrations. In a past talk, I shared how I have found it helpful in using emotional indicators in some of my diagrams as it can quickly illustrate things which are good or bad in the system. It also reduces how much text is needed to convey that message. Furthermore, I have found it helpful in controlling areas of focus. If you illustrate some scary piece of infrastructure, as something that looks scary or mean, your eyes gravitate to that in the illustration, ensuring you keep the audience focus on this area of concern. You can check out the talk here, which jumps right to this topic of Visualize your Idea: One of the main reasons that I like the usage of emotional indicators, is that they are simple and very accessible.

I found it valuable to proactively ensure I was providing communication on a routine basis. One piece of feedback I received was the overwhelming amount of communication people were already receiving through email. Much of this challenge was the volume or quality of these communications. I wanted to make sure these communications wouldn’t be contributing to this problem. Therefore, I wanted to make sure these were effective and easily digestible. My approach has been maintaining a central site that hosts a weekly CHANGELOG which gets published every Friday. When I publish these, I would send an email notification that would quickly summarize what content was included for the team to reference. As a result, this would only result in a single weekly email on a consistent schedule (every Friday). The content in the email would focus on highlighting what content is included in the site. Therefore, it was a simple and predictable sized message to indicate what to expect in the CHANGELOG. By proactively providing communication on a consistent schedule, I found that I was ensuring to share content with the team. Furthermore, I would also be checking with my leadership if they wanted to include anything in the CHANGELOG when I knew there could be possible topics may have questions based on recent changes that have occurred. By having a routine communication that concludes the work week (on a Friday), I found it to be a valuable point to provide a summary of that week. In that brief email that I would send to notify of the published CHANGELOG, I also felt it was important to conclude the email with a message of gratitude. I have often felt that I do not do enough in reminding team members of the impact they have through the work that they do. When you do the work of preparing what all has changed in a single week, you often capture achievements that are occurring through their work. It becomes a perfect opportunity to share that reminder of their impact as it becomes evident when they also see the changes that have occurred in the past week. Sharing gratitude is something we all can do more, and the CHANGELOG has served as a great way for me to do this routinely.

To assist in this effort, I try to keep a consistent format that breaks down the weekly events by listing different sections: Company: News related to the company, changes being applied throughout the company, or anything that spans beyond our current group. Culture: News related to engineering culture of the company. This can include announcements of internal meetups, tech talks, and hackathons. While it is not something that would be at the corporate-level, it is broader than your team and helps to have its own section. Group: News related to our current group. This often includes content from presentations that occurred within the group or reminders on requests made across the group. Sub-groups: News related to other groups you directly work with. External: News that may be highly relevant to the group, but relates to external sources. This may include external conferences, larger tech news related to a product you use, or any other industry related news that you think it would be valuable to share with the team. Having this consistent format helps in how people capture content from the CHANGELOG. Through these sections, it gives clear categories of what is included and makes it easier to consume in a short period of time. By applying it in the same format each time, it makes it easier to follow and navigate. Consistency can help those who are consuming the content, which is an important consideration as you are wanting this to be an easy, accessible set of information.

However, I felt it had some distinct differences to newsletters that I had experienced before. One apparent difference to me, was having a central site that hosts all of this content for each week, versus all of the content living in an email that is sent out on some schedule. When newer team members would join, they would have the full inventory of past CHANGELOGs to reference. Previously, it would require forwarding them all these past emails to obtain this same content. Furthermore, these were easier to share with others outside of our group. I found others referencing the CHANGELOG which weren’t even in our group, therefore expanding its value simply by reaching more people without me managing who was on the mailing list for the newsletter. Lastly, I would re-reference past CHANGELOGs when it had relevant information which helped remind people where they could go to find this same information themselves. If I forwarded them an email to share this information, I would be training them to ask me again to see if I could recall some past content from my inbox (which of course is not that helpful).

Rather than creating yet more things to read, I wanted to create more concise communication that was valuable to periodically receive and easily digestible for my team members.

A shareable location would be anywhere that others can also access and quickly locate the content (Microsoft OneNote, Google Doc). Make it known where they can find the notes by sharing the location (ex. link) in the meeting invite. This is helpful for other invitees who may not know where the team normally keeps their notes, or if the meeting is picking up from an earlier set of notes. Early in the meeting, it is helpful to identify who is taking notes to simply avoid duplicate efforts from occurring. With virtual meetings, I find sharing my screen while taking notes to be the optimal way of collecting information. Like pair programming, you instantly get feedback (additions, corrections) as you are taking notes. By establishing who is taking notes and sharing the screen while taking notes, you can achieve a rich single set of notes that others can leverage. By instilling good hygiene with note taking, you can transform what might just be a one-hour discussion into an effective working session which is building a documentation product that can be reused with others. This makes it a reliable way for team members who were not able to make it to the meeting to stay connected on the topic and reduces the need of attendees to replay the discussion for others.

This is because when people start to join, they may just see others in the meeting, but recognize nothing is being shared. After waiting with silence for sometime, someone may ask “Are we waiting for someone to start?” The host may then state “Yes, we are waiting for a few more to join before we get started.” After this is shared, the next set of people join, which then enter a meeting of more people, yet they don’t see or hear anything. They may then ask the same question as the earlier attendee, and then the host repeats what they stated earlier. You can solve this problem by just having something shared on the screen at the beginning of the meeting, like “We will be starting in a few minutes…” This doesn’t have to be anything fancy, but should be an obvious message that can quickly establish context as people join the meeting. They won’t have to ask if we plan on starting soon or having the host repeat stating the same message after each wave of attendees join.

It is a rich communication form, as there is an abundant amount of information being exchanged beyond just words. Facial expressions can quickly convey many other non-verbal queues that would otherwise be lost if you weren’t able to see the other person’s face. So, when joining a meeting, join with your camera on. It invites others to do the same thing, and it maximizes your communication time. Working at home, it is understandable that things may not seem as presentable, which may be your reason for not wanting to share your video. However, I have found that when I’m in a meeting where others are more relaxed in what they are sharing (and not caring what their hair may be looking like that day), you get a more enjoyable and effective moment of communication. It’s real and shows your willingness to be open to communicate with others in that rich setting, agnostic of any small imperfections that you could believe would hinder the aesthetics in how you present yourself. Finally, by sharing your video, you can get other effective information points that are beyond what is being spoken. For example, when someone steps away from their desk, you can clearly see they are not there and therefore you do not need to wait in an awkward pause for them to respond. If you know you will be moving around and it wouldn’t be advisable to share video, I find it helpful to just share that in the chat before the meeting (or send an email to the attendees). This helps with additional context, that you may only participate in the meeting by listening. It further reminds people that you still want to meet, but are unable to achieve your default expectation (by meeting and sharing your video). Make sure you share your video, as when you do, it invites others to do the same which can further enrich the quality of communication.

When you are in the physical presence of someone else, you would normally face them when you are speaking to them to quickly indicate they are the intended audience of a specific message. When you are in a virtual meeting, it is like you are facing everyone. To help capture people’s attention, I find it extremely helpful to preface statements with people’s names (much more than you would normally). When you use someone’s name, it quickly captures their attention. Through its use, it also helps give guidance to others on who you are expecting to provide a response. Practice referencing peoples names, it is an effective means of capturing attention and giving an indication to the group of who you expect should respond.

For me, I routinely have 1:1s with others, and used to make these walking meetings when we were physically at the same campus. I thoroughly enjoyed being able to go out and walk and talk with others. That is still possible with a virtual meeting, by simply checking with the other person if they would be interested. This can then help inform them, that it is OK to not share their video and there won’t be anything being shared on the screen, just a time to walk and talk. When I have done these, I have found some things work well, and some things require some additional adaptations. For example, I walk with a notepad and a pen, so I can take notes for things I want to follow-up on, but of course these are very brief things I write down as I’m not the greatest at writing in a notepad while walking (I’m already multi-tasking by walking and talking, I think I’m doing pretty good already 😄). Also, talking with someone over the phone while walking can have more audio problems (ex. the wind) than when you are in person. However, the few challenges I have faced in doing this have all been minor, and the benefits have always been greater than the cost. Finally, I find doing walking meetings work best just for 1:1s. While I’m sure you could make them work for other meetings with more participants, I just find it not to be as effective, at least when you plan to be an active participant (vs. maybe just listening in). I either am trying to look at my phone more while walking to see who is talking or I’m wanting to look something up that was mentioned, but it isn’t as convenient on my phone when walking. Therefore, I just keep it simple and try to apply this practice with 1:1s. If you haven’t tried this approach, I recommend at least trying it. If the colder weather is keeping you from going outside, I have even done it while walking in laps in my basement. It feels good to move around, and you may find it also helps your mind as well.

The “Old View” sees it where failure is caused in complex systems by the acts of fallible people. This view sees failure as an unpleasant surprise, not something which should occur. The way failure enters into the system is through people acting in unreliable ways. The “New View” looks at accidents as being normal. It tries to seek to understand how people made their decisions in these events. It sees “human error” as the starting point for investigation, instead of the conclusion on why something occurred. It also believes that everyone is well-intentioned in their work. This is based on the local rationality principle, which can be described in that we choose to do the rational thing based on what we know about the current situation - what is local to us. This is based on what our current goals are at the time. If something doesn’t make sense in doing it by not aligning to our goal, we simply wouldn’t do it.

If the outcome is bad, then you are not only more willing to judge the decisions, but also more likely to judge them more harshly. While we would all love the ability to predict the future, this bias can make it challenging when viewing a past decision that resulted in a negative outcome. You have good people with good intentions to support your systems. Good decisions made from good intentions can result in negative outcomes. The inverse of this is also true, where a bad process that is followed can still result in a good outcome. Don’t start with the outcome and work backwards to how they made their decision. It drags the context of how this future perspective should have been known (which isn’t possible without a time machine).

In other words, as a retrospective reviewer who knows the outcome of an event, you exaggerate your own ability to predict and prevent the outcome - while not even being aware of that bias. This bias often affects our ability to cleanly look at a decision afterwards. To combat the influences of this bias, we must seek the perspective of the decision makers at that moment in time. What did they know? How did they know about it? More than likely they wouldn’t have made the same decision if they knew it would have resulted in a negative outcome. We should recognize that by knowing the resulting outcome, we will tend to elevate the possibility of this potential outcome when assessing the situation. This influencer can limit our ability of learning, as we start judging others as to why they wouldn’t have perceived this as being a probable outcome. Rather, try to maximize your learning in seeking what they were experiencing and how they were making decisions during this event. Do this without comparing it to the resulting outcome. Avoid using the words “why” and “who,” as those are strong signals that you are judging those in the event. Practice using “what” and “how” to learn more about the event without indicating an individual is to blame in the overall system.

The blunt end is the organization that supports or constrains the actions of the sharp end. The sharp end represents the group of humans that are directly involved in the safety-critical part of the process. The blunt end influences the behavior of the sharp end, though it isn’t typically the area of focus. For example, it may encourage the sharp end to hurry up or it may increase the workload the sharp end must manage which can increase its operational stress.

However, there is always a second story beneath this first story. It is one that is much more complex, but looks more at the overall system than just an individual. It looks at both the blunt and sharp ends of that system. It includes influences of people, processes, technology, and management. To learn and understand more about a failure, we should seek the second story.

There may be three different git commits that create one logical important thing to know. I see this being similar when something is communicated to humans through series of emails. Something important may be shared that you want to share with others, but if you share it with others, they must do a depth-first search of the email conversation thread and then rewind all of it to understand why it is important. To simplify this, you want the provider of the content to quickly summarize the important topic and why they believe it is important, with the ability to reference the details (if curiosity remains).

Since many of us look at life in the lens of software, I thought using the analogy of a CHANGELOG is helpful. The goal is to create a concise summary of notable changes for other people to use and get the benefit. An email notification is then sent to those to consume the content. Rather than this content only being in an email, if others find this information helpful, they can simply cross reference the site (rather than forcing them to forward an email). In the past, I have seen others give a “news email” to their team, and then include another team’s “news email” in their email. To avoid that, I’m just making it a site, which has a simple timeline by dates. Each week, you could view it like a release, but I will treat all of them as minor releases (ex. 2020.17), which is YYYY.ww, where each minor release is the next week. Don’t worry, this totally follows semantic versioning 😄. I have started doing this for the past couple of weeks, and have received good feedback. Here are some of my observations and feedback so far: It has allowed me to avoid repeating news in my 1:1s.

I feel less of a burden to ensure people are staying well informed, and I feel like it is a more stable communication channel for them to stay up-to-date. I have been able to cross-reference content in the site when people ask questions to topics that happen to be shared in the CHANGELOG. This helps indicate to others how to stay subscribed in future weeks by sharing the source of this content versus having to type it out again (or forward a email with a bunch of other content to filter). I have had questions from others about the content that shows interest in what is shared, and have heard how people like it to be categorized, so it is easy to quickly capture content that seems applicable to them.

Problem solving for many of these software issues can require a significant amount of time based on their level of complexity. However, the amount of time that is required is also dependent on the quality of the time. For example, if we were to simply state it would take three hours to solve a problem, and we would be allocated three hours of focus time (ex. a quite room from distractions), would you consider having one three hour block of time or a series of smaller blocks of times (ex. one hour and four 30 minute blocks of time which have small interruptions between them)? Generally, people would prefer having a single three hour block of time versus having a series of smaller blocks of time that are spread out. This comic (by Jason Heeris) I think easily summarizes the need of having larger contiguous blocks of time to focus for an engineer: While it is expected that you will many times have breaks during these periods of working on a problem, there is a known tax of getting into a problem space. Once you are into that problem space and are interrupted to go do something else (ex. go to another meeting), you have to pay a similar tax again to continue working on that problem. Therefore, it is generally optimal to avoid how many times you are interrupted once you are entering into that problem space. Hence, you value contiguous blocks of time, just like your old magnetic hard drive for optimally reading data 😄. Note: It is common with large contiguous blocks of time to take small breaks to allow your mind to briefly wander if you find you are stuck on a problem. These small breaks should be controlled by you to dictate when they are needed, not by external forces which lack association to your problem solving process.

Meaning, I schedule time on my calendar to work on problems that are currently on my plate. I previously wouldn’t have bothered blocking off time on my calendar to just work on a problem, but I found the first step in controlling my schedule required that I was the primary author of my schedule. When I started implementing this, I found that I was still getting a decent amount of calendar invites which would be scheduled during the time I already had blocked off (posing as a conflict). Often, I would just go to the meeting that was schedule, and surrender the needed time I had reserved for the other problem. While I received advice from others that I should decline those meeting requests, I found that the organizer would often have to follow-up on when to reschedule. This resulted in them further evaluating my schedule, trying to find another close time which could be negotiated into their desired schedule. I used to block off periods of problem solving as “Dev” on my schedule, and when I would decline a meeting because it conflicted, I would then be asked in a chat with the organizer if I could make an alternative time that would be again during a “Dev” meeting. Therefore, they would see this “Dev” time block and then would be questioning if I could miss it. They could see that it was only a meeting on my calendar (no one else invited), which then seemed less important. Others would tell me to be more explicit on naming these blocks of time on my schedule, like “Required working session [Do Not Book]\"; however, that didn’t stop from me having to still explain if I could miss this meeting in favor of some newer event. For this approach to be more effective, I had to apply one other change: changing permissions of my calendar.

The issue I found that I was still struggling with was spending time negotiating when I could be free versus having the organizer only look at when I’m free on my calendar. I then decided to apply permissions on my calendar so that I could make my team see all the details of my calendar (ex. description, who it is with), but only give everyone else the ability to see when I’m free or busy (they cannot see the details of the meeting). Therefore, if I received an invite from my immediate team on something, I could quickly assess if this conflict was a higher priority to attend; otherwise, if it was from someone outside of my immediate team I would simply decline and state I wasn’t free during this time. If I were to get a follow-up from the organizer of when I was free, I would state that anywhere which shows free on my calendar, they can book. This removed the time I would sometimes spend explaining why I couldn’t make it based on my current work demand, but rather kept it simple to the process of following the calendar. Another thing to note, is that you must not eagerly block too much time on your schedule, as you will more than likely still be spending time trying to explain if you can or cannot make some other meeting since you are not providing sufficient amount of time options for them to choose. Make it easy for everyone, if it is free on my calendar, then that is a time I can meet; otherwise, I won’t be able to make it.

If you have routine meetings in place, remember to periodically check if this schedule works for everyone.

Track hosts that have been identified as experts in that domain, then do the work of identifying speakers to talk in these tracks. This approach makes it very clean on how they have direct selection on the talks to ensure they fulfill the targeted track and the speakers are known for being good at public speaking. As a result, majority of the talks are well prepared and are conveyed in an effective way. The conference was held all within a single location, Hyatt Regency in San Francisco, which made the logistics for attendees quite convenient. It was easy to get to and from talks, allowing you more time to strike conversations with others, and lowering the stress of having to determine where do I need to go next. I was attending this conference as a speaker, so I had some added stress of preparing for my talk beforehand, but was really honored to have the opportunity to attend and speak. QCon does a fantastic job of preparing you for the talk, with resources on how to give a good talk and opportunities for others to review the talk for early feedback. While I was stressed on making sure I had prepared enough for my talk (my talk was on the last day of the conference), I was able to focus mostly on the other talks as I had finished my content earlier and had a chance to practice it to ensure it was within the targeted time. While at the conference, I had the opportunity to connect and talk with many other engineers and practitioners. By being in San Francisco, I was able to reconnect with a couple former colleagues which made it a really valuable time. I then was able to connect with other speakers which I found extremely valuable. For the last few months I have been having to dive deeper into container security, building minimal OS images, and scanning these for security related vulnerabilities. At a social dinner for speakers of the conference, I was able to connect with Nisha Kumar, and was able to get a lot of valuable insight from her work on tern and validate some of the container image building challenges we have been experiencing. When talking with others at lunch and breaks, I was always interested to find where others were from and what they were working on. Several times I found people some tie back to the Kansas City area (where I’m from) or work in the related industry (healthcare). By having my talk announced before the conference, I also had some other planned meetings with companies and start-ups to learn more about what they were trying to solve, and how it related to challenges we were facing at our company. Having these scheduled meetings were valuable to have additional conversations that I wouldn’t probably normally engage if I didn’t plan beforehand.

It is enjoyable to learn about newer technologies and different things we haven’t used before. Through this discovery, it is easy to start to favor these newer findings over things we have used before. It is important to recognize that our learning is drawn through this attraction of novelty. It keeps us hungry to learn and find new things. However, we don’t want to forget that it is easy to form a bias that values newer things over older things. Therefore, when assessing a technology that is new, you may automatically associate more value to what is new without considering all the costs that it might bring. As a result, newer things gain these bonus points in our internal merit system, and can cause us to continue to favor it even after we assess it strengths and weaknesses.

In this talk, he highlights the cost considerations of introducing something new into your system. While it can be valid to pursue a new option for solving your problem, you should be extremely sensitive to these newer costs and ensure you are limiting your concurrent intake of “new things.” I don’t think we generally like to pursue boring things; however, I have learned to like the label of boring technologies as it highlights one extreme of this spectrum of choices. We are wanting to favor proven technologies that are well established. Therefore, I see boring as a powerful word that we recognize in this spectrum (it has emotional ties when you think of it). As a result, I think it assists in reminding us of our tendency to get lost in this desire of using something new and shiny. When we get lost in these new and shiny things, we can lose sight of these overall costs that they bring. I like how Dan highlights this point in the following statement: Costs to operate a technology in perpetuity tend to outstrip the convenience you get by using something different. We want to seek options that lessen the operational concerns of living with that choice. When you want to introduce something new, recognize you should limit how much can be introduced in your system due to the larger costs that this change will bring. Recognize that you may be favoring something new, and giving it more value simply because it is “new.” If you find it is the right thing to introduce, ensure you have a plan to remove what may already exists that this would eventually be replacing. Operational cognitive load (something that Matt Klein often refers to) is a real cost that can easily grow in your system if you are allowing newer things to be introduced, but not managing away what it replaces. Understand that we have an appeal to novelty, and that appeal feeds our hunger to learn and try new things. However, don’t allow this appeal to negatively affect your decisions on technology, as it is easy to lose sight of the costs that newer things can bring.

If you are not familar with this law, it was coined by Edward A Murphy Jr. during his work on a high-speed rocket sled experiment for the US Air Force where he shared: Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. This belief was reminded to me when I used to work in a machine shop, and you would extensively try to control all the sources of variance that may disrupt what you were machining. There would always be some unforeseen source that would cause you to incorrectly remove too much material, which would then violate the necessary tolerances of the very thing you were trying to build (requiring you to build it again). Whenever this would happen, I would hear my boss just say: “Murphy…”. I believe this thought (that anything can fail) that can shape our thinking and decision making in ways we don’t always expect.

Through the lens of Murphy’s Law, we expect that anything we rely upon will fail. This is helpful through early exercises in system design, in that you try to identify sources of failure and their resulting impact. Essentially, thinking through assumptions your system may have and declaring your reliance on those assumptions is a valuable exercise. This many times can also extrapolate single points of failure, which are paramount in capturing early as these often take longer to identify when they are nestled deep in layers of abstracted infrastructure. By thinking of Murphy’s Law, we expand our perception of what can fail and therefore consider a wide variety of assumptions and dependencies of our systems. As a result, we may be able to identify weaknesses early and hopeful avoid these before we actually ever experience them in the systems we operate.

I mentioned earlier that there are benefits in this exploration of potential failures, it can also be overwhelming when viewing through this lens. This lens views into the infinite universe of the negative. There are an unlimited amount of things that can fail or go wrong. What I have often seen, is that many experienced engineers have a large list of painful past system failures they have experienced. It is easy for them to recall how each of these could happen in some new system we are building. While these perspectives are valuable, they can be misleading without some added context of probability. For example, sharing at least how many times they may have experience that type of failure over the lifespan of a previous system can help articulate the probability of that failure. This helps in capturing what is a valid concern of this potential failure mode, but also collectively leveraging past experiences on the probability of it occurring, and what type of environment allowed it to occur (valuable context to understand its validity). Therefore, we understand that we vividly remember our painful failures of the past. These memories are valuable to leverage to ensure we don’t allow these to occur again in our lives. However, we must also recognize that sharing additional context, like the system environment that invited the failure and the historical frequency of this failure is important pairing of information. This is so we don’t allow ourselves to miss other (more probable) failures due to our bias of these unique and scary past scenarios.

If you just look at the final product, you are many times satisfied, and may be further impressed if you knew what it looked like before. However, when you have a photo of the before and the after, progress is quickly illustrated through contrast. It is like those home improvement shows where they summarize at the end of how bad something looked before and how it now looks after a remodel. When viewing the current state by contrasting it with the past, you can easily capture progress and the impact of the change. While this is easy with physical things that we change, this is many times harder with software. With software changes, it isn’t always an easy task to illustrate how the software has changed. We many times use data that directed us to make the change (ex. the metric on response time was too high and should be lowered) to then show the impact. While sharing how metrics change is always interesting, I think how this information is delivered is something we should also focus on. By focusing on how our data is presented and delivered to our teams, we can increase the value of the metric in what people remember and realize from its benefits.

For example, if you are comparing how this change will further optimize a user’s workflow, having it illustrated by an expert is a great artifact to then compare. Gathering a screen recording of the workflow also captures the timing of the software and any non-optimal workflows of using it (which you can then highlight later). This recording can be played side-by-side (before and after), which shows timing differences, and possibly less steps in the workflow. I have used this before to share with others how much their change had an impact of what it was like before, as the contrast is quite large in comparison. Furthermore, when you share the story that the person who recorded the workflow is an expert in using it, it also allows the audience to visualize others who would not be as proficient benefiting even further. This point is somewhat important, in that you don’t want their imagination to go in the inverse, and think “Yeah, that looks impactful for new users, but most people who are experienced wouldn’t get that big of a benefit.” Furthermore, by showing the previous state, you are also informing others what life is like in the software, as you will find newer team members which do not have this context or simply existing team members that have gotten disconnected from the actual user experience. Sometimes our software changes are automating other manual tasks, which you would have to essentially video record someone to see what they would have done before to provide a contrast. One thing I have seen people do is capture the amount of time it takes someone to do it manually, and show how that time isn’t spent anymore. This is a common practice to identify the cost of something based on human hours required, but many times when this is shared as just a number, it can seem weak based on its actual impact. A number doesn’t quickly produce a visualization of the painstaking time and frustration that is removed from the user, it is just a number. In a similar scenario, I found how the process we were automating had a process guide, which had many pages of steps. I decided to build an image which was a mosaic zoomed-out view of all these pages. This visual look intimidating on the size of the document, and alluded a bunch of complexity (without having to explain anything about it). I then shared how many pages were comprised in this guide, and then you could include the human time it would take. By showing a visual of something like pages of the process it took before, and how we were reducing it (highlighting a section that would be removed), it strengthened the point more than just a number which doesn’t carry much emotional power when initially shared. To generate this visual, here is an example using The Go Programming Language (the free sample chapter). With this, I generated an image per page, then generated an HTML table of all the images. From this view, I take a screenshot and then may highlight a section of content that we would be removing through automation. This gives context of what you are removing, by contrasting what already pre-exists.

There are different tools that I use which will recommend for a given distribution of numbers to share it in a pie chart, rather than the good ole bar chart. Why should you avoid pie charts and favor bar charts? Here are a few: Lack of contrast: Since this post is about contrast, pie charts don’t make it obvious of relative contrast to others. If you have five different percentages, and two of those are very close (ex. 23% and 25%), it isn’t obvious from a quick glance the contrast between the two. Which one is larger or smaller? Lack of order: Feeding off of the lack of contrast, there isn’t an obvious order to the metrics, so you aren’t able to quickly see the order and comparison between the numbers. With a bar chart, it is easy to order them, so when the numbers may be very close, the contrast still exists through a clear ordering scheme (ex. top to bottom or left to right). Suffering from several numbers: If you have just a few numbers you want to compare (like three to five), a pie chart can struggle with this. Once you get more than just two numbers to show distribution, the pie chart makes it difficult to understand the difference of relative size.

All too often I have seen people later in life hesitant to ask questions or share their initial ideas from the effects of imposter syndrome. When working with younger kids, many of them are not afraid to share their ideas or questions. They also quickly share some really imaginative ideas, some of which may be unrelated to the original topic, but by them just sharing that idea, friends would then start sharing other ideas quickly upon it.

This is also the final part of my trilogy on guidance with email (Email Trilogy blog series). Throughout our work, we are continuously challenged with newer problems to solve. As we encounter these obstacles, we realize we can’t do it alone. Consequently, we routinely ask others for help. In my experience, I found I was often asking other engineers to present in a technical meetup that I was helping organize. In these scenarios, I discovered that I was making an ask that required little effort on my behalf, but for someone to say yes, they would have to do a considerable amount of additional work to prepare for a talk. When people accepted this request and ended up helping me, I really wanted to make sure I expressed how I thankful I was. I discovered a simple approach that I found valuable, which are “thank you emails.” In this post, I will share how I like to send a follow-up “thank you” through email, after I have thanked them in-person. ","date":"Feb 25, 2019","objectID":"/posts/thank-you-emails/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Thank You Emails","uri":"/posts/thank-you-emails/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Thank You Emails You are probably thinking, “isn’t it just saying thanks in an email?” Well, yes, but there was a few ingredients to the email (when sending them within work) which I thought made them more effective, and hence, worthy to share. Here is a common approach in how I thank others by using email: For the TO line of the address, I include the person’s manager and their executive I would then include the person I was thanking, on the BCC line (as a blind copy). I will share later on why I do this. For the body of the email, I would then state how thankful I was to the manager and executive of how their team member helped out. This would briefly include what and when they did it and why it was valuable to me (in only a few sentences). I would then end the email reminding them that I know what they did took additional effort, and how thankful I was for their contribution. If anything, make sure your email includes a meaningful why you are thankful. This is the essence of the personalized feeling in the message. The reason why I include the person that I’m thanking on the BCC, is that I wanted to make sure they get the message as well, but I also wanted to make sure their manager and executive have a desire to follow-up with the person. Having the email target their leadership, helps make sure they know what kind of impact the person is doing, and the additional work they are contributing. I found that when the person I was directly thanking wasn’t an obvious recipient of the email, their manager either authored their own thank you email and include the person on the email chain, or they would talk to them later about it to share what they heard (which further energizes the thank you). Therefore, by using email (which is a private discussion), I could deliver a short message that seemed more personal and would invite a follow-up. By including organizational leaders on a thank you email, your thanks can expand beyond just the individual’s inbox. This helps others realize their impact, and can also help in performance reviews where their leadership wasn’t aware of their helpful act without you sharing about it. In summary, these thank you emails are a short and simple way to start following up on helpful acts. Keeping organization leaders on the message, and inviting them to share their thanks with the individual helps increase the impact of your thanks. In a future post, I will share another approach I have found to be valuable for thanking people through a more public forum: a blog. Finally, by expressing your thankfulness, you will also probably have a higher probability of getting help in the future 😀.

However, I think there are some other important rules of when to produce email. In this short post, I will share a couple things to keep in mind before you send an email. Email is where your keystrokes go to die Several years back, I watched this talk by Scott Hanselman on Scaling Yourself, which touches on several topics on how to improve your productivity. Of these topics, one of the phrases that stuck with me was: Email is where your keystrokes go to die. This quote is a reference to how email consumes a limited resource: your keystrokes. Knowing we all have a limited amount of time on this planet, we also have a limited amount of keystrokes before we die. When you are emailed a question, it is inviting you to respond back with an answer to their question. If you are feeling generous, you may send them a very well documented answer with code examples and references, which is a large gift of keystrokes. The primary problem with this approach, is that you just gifted a limited audience (only those on the TO or CC line) a large set of your keystrokes, and you don’t even know if they will read it. Scott gives the advice that you should never send a long email. If you do, you should write it in a blog, wiki, knowledge base, or issue tracking system, and then email them the link. This way, your gift of keystrokes can be expanded to a much larger audience. Furthermore, your gift of keystrokes can live on beyond your time on this planet (and are not trapped in someone’s inbox folder). Don’t waste your keystrokes in email, allow them to live on in publicly accessible and searchable locations. Don’t Train People to Respond in the After Hours Something I have struggled with in my own career, is reading and responding to work related emails outside of normal business hours. Meaning, when getting an email from someone about an issue at work (that does not require an immediate response), and then responding that same evening with the follow-up. Once you send an email, it invites a response. Furthermore, it invites an unhealthy behavior of leveraging people’s willingness to help, but doing it when it is not necessary. I believe most people are interested in helping each other, at least those they closely work with. By sending the email in the late hours, they may also see it and feel compelled to respond, even though it isn’t necessary to be done immediately. You can slightly change this behavior, by not indicating to your team that it is healthy to be working late. To do this, you can leverage what several email services offer, which is scheduling when the email is sent to your recipients. This allows you to send your email when it works for you (when the question is your head), but doesn’t deliver it to your recipients until a later, healthier period (ex. the following morning @ 8 AM). Examples of this are Outlook’s Send Later or using Boomerang with Gmail. While, I believe it is important to have your own approach of how you digest email, don’t assume you know how other people digest their emails. Avoid sending emails in the after hours that invite a response when it simply isn’t urgent. If it can wait till the morning, allow it to be delivered with that same timeline.

While this statement was delivered with humor, I found it to be true with many engineers. As they grew with experience, so did the amount of time they spent giving presentations. By presentations, I simply mean sharing or pitching their ideas to larger audiences (their team, group, organization, or even the entire company). With this increase of sharing ideas, they many times are also working on presentation material (i.e. slides), which is often considered an unpleasant activity. I have noticed this in my own career, where I am routinely spending time building presentation material, which doesn’t deliver the same feeling of joy as compared to writing code. However, as I have spent a extensive amount of time both building presentations and witnessing them, I find these to be a powerful moment where you can help inform and learn from your technical ideas. In this short post, I will share some guidance I have gotten on building presentation slides. This guidance can serve as some design principles when dealing with the pptx language. My ultimate hope is that these are specific enough where you can easily apply the guidance, but general enough to not constrain how you share it.

All to often, we get caught up in the features these editors (Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides, Apple Keynote) offer, but rather lose sight of what we want to use them for: a visual aide. When you are presenting a topic to a group of people, your slides can serve as a significant influence in how well they remember your content. Furthermore, they dictate how well you can ensure they even pay attention, and follow the order in how you want your content digested. Your slides are intended to be your visual aide in the presentation. You are the presentation, not the slides.

Therefore, there are a few things to remember which these factors can contribute problems in your visual aides: Unintentional sizing: Typical slide templates have the headline at the top, which has the largest font size. The headline is then used to just list a category for the slide, and therefore the element which has the most attention due to size (the headline), is generally the least important element of content. Unnecessary motion: Having unnecessary animation or motion on the slide, that isn’t being used to guide the audience of what they should be looking at currently, but rather to make it look “neat.” Excessive color: Having many different signal colors included with imagery, which draws your attention, but the imagery doesn’t strongly correlate to any messaging. As a result, your audience doesn’t remember what message was being shared to trigger the image. The image might look colorful and amazing, but that doesn’t assist in helping the audience capture the message.

One of these bad behaviors is bullet points. I use bullet points all the time to provide a listing of discussion points (like this blog post), but in a visual aide, you have to be mindful in how you share them. Here are a few things to be mindful about bullet points in a presentation…delivered via bullet points 😀: Amount of content: When you show a bullet list to an audience, it can quickly be overwhelming if there are many points shared all at once. You also lose your audience’s focus as you are talking if too much is being shared in that one moment. Rather than sharing it all at once, limit how much you share as you are talking. For example, visually grey out content already shared, and highlight/bold what you are currently talking about in the list. Size of font: When you include more bullet points for a listing of content, most presentation software automatically handles this by scaling down your font. The more you reduce the size of your content, the more you are reducing its importance to your audience (remember, we notice big things). Rather than reducing the size of your font, reduce how many bullet points you share per slide. Strive to keep the total amount of objects to six per slide, and each bullet point is considered an object. More text will result in less imagery: We are visual creatures. As mentioned earlier, you want to limit the amount of objects that are on your slides. Bullet points of text quickly take away the placement of visual imagery that could improve the attraction or ability for someone to remember the content. Reserve one of your objects you share as an image, and don’t exclusively show bullet points on slides.

Here are a few tips to minimize distracting your audience for nothing: Don’t feel compelled to have a title on the slide: I strongly value consistency of style throughout a presentation, but that doesn’t mean you need to have a large banner of text at the top of your slides which just lists a category. You can still include a title / category on your slide, but it could be smaller text at the footer, to help provide context for the audience. It isn’t required, so don’t feel you must have it unless the context is useful when quickly viewing your slide. You don’t always have to show something: These are visual aides, it is perfectly fine to have your next slide be a black background (nothing to see). As you continue to talk, your audience will then simply direct their attention solely to you. Note, be sure to do this at a point of a transition, not “randomly” while you are talking. If it doesn’t seem like a transition, they may think something is wrong with your visual aide and then try to contact you to make you aware of the situation (“Uh, Bill, your slides aren’t showing…\"), which creates a distraction. Avoid leaving slides up with high attraction power, and little needed content: I have seen presentations with a bright white background, and simply one word on the slide, that’s like “Hello.” People continue to stare at this slide as the person introduces themselves. It like this slide is drawing them in, well beyond the time necessary to read the single word. One alternative to having this type of slide, is to not show anything at all (black screen), so everyone looks at you as you introduce yourself. A second alternative, is to have an image, which strongly represents you and quickly creates a memorable moment in your audience. Remember the intention of your visual aide, and don’t allow it to steal one of the sensory units of your audience (their eyes) by not delivering any part of your message. Using animated memes unnecessarily: We all fall victim to wanting to include something entertaining, but I have seen cases where someone thinks it would be good to include some animated GIF that references a funny meme in the corner of their slide, which is right next to the main points they are sharing. This results in people being distracted by the entertaining loop of the video, and not capturing what you are saying. While I definitely enjoy some fine animated memes, deliver them in isolation and don’t allow them to linger long as you share your message. Be mindful of what you include, and recognize its strong ability of distraction.

While I believe images are powerful things to include with content that can improve what your audience remembers, it can also be a pain to find valuable content. Something I have found helpful in doing visuals is using my own illustrations for slides. Here are some benefits of doing this: Uniqueness: When using your own drawings, they are very unique. That uniqueness helps in how people remember your content. Also, the element of novelty with your drawings also improves attraction to the imagery. Knowing you don’t want the image to be distracting for your points, you can make the image custom to what you want to share. Simple: Don’t think you need to be a great artist to do this. Simple sketches can really be powerful in what you are describing. By focusing on a simple image, you will be amazed how quickly you can illustrate something that doesn’t need to be complex. They naturally leverage contrast: Simple cartoon illustrations have a great element of contrast (black on white), which is easy to see and has strong attraction powers. You can then consciously choose to inject color where you may want to bring awareness or highlighting a point. Do not think you need color on your images to make them effective. Feels human: When I share my drawings, or see illustrations from others, there is this basic human element that is exposed in the image. By the image not being perfect, but being original and authored from the individual, it seems more authentic and human. So much of the images online or in generic presentations appear unreal or edited , and don’t seem authentic to who is sharing the message. When the image is authored by you, it brings this added element of authenticity, regardless of how good or poor the image looks. I plan to do a future blog post of how I started doing my illustrations in a very low-fi way, to show that it can be easy to start and you shouldn’t be afraid to try. Note, I realize that several people may think they are not good at drawing, and these points wouldn’t work for them. That may be true, but I would at least try it first. I didn’t think it would work well for me either, but once I started doing it, it actually made me enjoy doing visual aides, as I like practicing to draw.

Team traditions can help build the identity or brand of a team, which is generally helpful in supporting the overall health of the team. By having a team which has a unique and strong identity, it many times indicates a strong connective bond between the team members. As the lifespan of a team grows over time, traditions can continue to form which further crystalize these unique elements of their identity. One tradition I have found, which may seem innocent, can have larger negative effects than desired. This tradition is what I will call Defect Donuts. In this short post, I will share the importance of focusing on positive reinforcement within in a team, and avoiding punishment when seeking ways to motivate desired behaviors.

For example, if you check-in code which introduces a defect, the defect will introduce some cost to your team. Your software quits working in some environment, tests begin failing, and maybe a team member has to engage in some investigation to find out your code change introduced the problem. Since you realize your mistake had a negative impact on the team, you feel bad and want to make amends. The tradition of Defect Donuts establishes an expectation that you then bring in donuts the following day to indicate that you are sorry for the issue and recognize the impact. This tradition reminds the team of the importance of not making mistakes. While no one wakes up in the morning with a plan to make mistakes, this tradition highlights when someone makes a mistake within the development ecosystem of the team. When the mistake is identified, the team then seeks a human for the cause, as that team member is then responsible for brining in donuts. As part of a team, you want the entire team to support a system of producing software. The system becomes the focus of improvement when you encounter issues which have entered into your code. Therefore, while humans compose your system of building software, you don’t seek for a specific human as the cause of the issue, but rather how did the overall system allow it. For example, if a code change that was introduced that could have been caught with static analysis in your build, you would seek to introduce static analysis in your build, versus identifying the single human that didn’t know this and then ask them to bring donuts so they would learn from that mistake.

With reinforcements, there are generally two categories: positive or negative reinforcement. As the names imply, positive reinforcement is when you provide a reward for a desired behavior. Negative reinforcement is when you remove something (like something unpleasant) as a result of desired behavior. Other ways of influencing behaviors, is through punishments. These can be imposed by introducing or removing something when you see an undesirable behavior. In the case of Defect Donuts, you are imposing a punishment for someone to go buy donuts (which might not be that bad of a punishment), and then you also have a slight positive reinforcement to team for getting donuts by identifying a single human identified as a cause of an issue. From my experience, you generally want to focus on utilizing positive reinforcement for encouraging human behaviors, and seldomly use negative reinforcement or punishments. While they all can be effective to some degree, favoring the use of positive reminders generally have better effectiveness, and can be used more frequently while also staying effective.

When it is triggered, it is simply trying to serve as an apology, since they know their change had an undesirable effect on the team. I found it more effective to simply remind people of the good work they are doing with donuts, vs. donuts being triggered from a punishment. Encourage them to find defects, and not hinder on sharing their own mistakes for the cost of some punishment. Furthermore, you don’t have to worry about some negative association being tied to one of the greatest activities that exist, eating donuts.

Meaning, not where can I find yet more information, but how can I optimally use this information in my life. In this short post, I will share something that has worked for me in my life, which I didn’t intentionally seek, but found that it produced an optimal setting for me to reach a creative thinking period in my mind. ","date":"Jan  4, 2019","objectID":"/posts/large-dog-method/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"The Large Dog Method: A Path to Creative Thinking","uri":"/posts/large-dog-method/"},{"categories":null,"content":"What is Creative Thinking? I’m labeling creative thinking as a period when your mind is able to deeply process a topic, but also look at different ways of applying what you have previously learned. Much of what I was finding in my life, was taking what I have learned, and quickly applying it to problems or choices. While this is an important skill, these solutions aren’t something I would categorize as very creative. While one could view these solutions as having creativity, they were closely aligned to how problems were solved in the past. Therefore, I view creative thinking as a means of coming up with new ideas that take what I have learned from the past, but look at the problem differently to come up with hopefully a better and different solution. Some view this as lateral thinking, where you are trying to seek an alternative means of viewing a problem. In addition to this type of thinking, I found a need of allowing your mind to wander to increase your level of creativity. While this doesn’t sound like an efficient use of your brain, many times the way you view the world or a problem becomes more fixed the longer you focus on it. By finding ways to allow your mind to wander, by prepping your brain with the problem set that you want to think about, you actually can find ways of getting unstuck. Early in my software engineering career, I was given the advice of when you get stuck on a problem, to get up an go get a Coke from the vending machine, and then come back to the problem. This simple break from that mode of thinking, allowed you to re-approach the problem which can possibly help you get out of being stuck. While I don’t find this simple trick really engaging in creative thinking, it does hit some of the same simple points of getting unstuck on how you are viewing a problem. To achieve having your brain re-engaged, it actually required you to briefly disengage. Therefore, I found creative thinking a combination of lateral thinking with an inviting environment to allow your brain to wander. This combination helps you both view problems differently, but not force your mind to solve some problem with the typical conditional paths in your brain. While I’m in no way a scientist that studies the brain, I do believe these to be effective ingredients to reach a creative thinking period.

There are many great benefits that dogs provide for humans, but for this article, I won’t really get into all those details. I will simply explain how our furry family member helped find an important time in my day, which was a creative thinking time. Our family has a large dog, which the size of the dog I think matters for this topic. With a large dog, they require more things, more food, more furniture or toys to destroy, and more time to walk. In order to keep our dog happy, we found we needed to walk him daily. These walks generally were around 3 miles, and it would take us typically 35 - 40 minutes to walk. Sometimes we found ourselves also extending this walk, depending on our available time. However, one thing that didn’t really vary, was how often we needed to walk him (daily). It wasn’t until later in his life and as we had children, we found we weren’t walking him as much. At this point, I found that he brought something into my life that I didn’t realize I was getting till it wasn’t occurring as much. This gift was a routine schedule of longer walks that became my creative thinking time. What I’m labeling as The Large Dog Method is an approach to routinely achieve a period of creative thinking in a busy life. It is composed of the following supporting parts: Routine: By having a large dog, he demands to be walked every day to be happy. If he is not happy, his size is threatening enough through barking or destroying your property to incentivize you to honor his request. Having a friend to keep you accountable on doing this exercise routinely, helps you stay consistent and builds an established pattern in your schedule. Walking invites wandering: Research indicates that the act of walking is an optimal exercise of reaching a creative thinking state. By allowing your mind to wander, it allows you think and look at things differently. To reach a wandering state, you generally need a longer isolated set of time. By having a large dog, you engage in walking for a longer period, allowing you enough time to reach this state of thinking. Lack of conversation: When I was walking our dog, I many times enjoyed catching up on my podcasts. However, when I simply went without listening to anything, I just walked and thought. Our dog didn’t demand any conversation, and he was completely happy as a result of it. Whenever you would walk with anyone else, you generally always have a conversation, but you wouldn’t be doing any deep thinking. Having a setting that doesn’t compel you to do other things, like talking, helps minimize other common forms of distraction from reaching a deeper state of thinking. Avoiding costly distractions: When walking your dog, you will get distractions, but these distractions don’t generally extend into too many other things. For example, you might have another dog come up that wants to say hello, or you have be aware of traffic when crossing the street. These distractions are short, and do not invite you to get detracted from this longer prolong state of thinking. At home, if I’m reading something online or hearing something on the TV, those distractions have many invitations to read yet another article, tweet, YouTube video, or whatever else that doesn’t really support this desirable state of thinking.

I wanted to share this thought of The Large Dog Method, only because I think we all need to reflect on where are spending our time, and seek for these moments of deep and creative thinking. I never planned on getting a dog so I could get more time to think about problems. However, I realized that our dog gave me this gift, and it became my way of ensuring I had time in my schedule for this type of thinking. In a world with an endless amount of distractions and digesting ideas that are as short as a tweet, I have found it very valuable to ensure you have time to intentionally disconnect and think. Even having enough time to think about thinking. Seek this in your life, and you will find that your brain can produce great results when given the opportunity. For me, having a large dog created these moments, so intentionally seek what is the “large dog” in your life, or if you don’t have it, create it.

Given that email is such a common element of communication that everyone deals with, and it has been around for a long time, there are generally several different ways of optimizing this continuous amount of content. Here is my process of how I manage my email at work, which I realize is quite simple. Perhaps you can share with me how you do it better, and I can further improve my approach: Turn off notifications for new emails I realize many people rely on knowing when they get a new email, to act on it. I have found this to actually be very unproductive for a large set of tasks for knowledge workers. Meaning, you generally have tasks that require deep thought or prolong concentration. To do these tasks effectively, you don’t want things invading your concentration, especially when you are equipping any person with the ability of doing it by just including your name on the “TO:” line of an email. While I have learned how others have optimized their alerts with rules based on the sender, I find it better to change the way I consume email. I don’t alert when I get email, and I chose to read my email with intentional blocks of time. Have you ever had that moment when you feel really productive, then realized your email client wasn’t running? Well, you can achieve this as well, but just control when you engage in responding or working through the email in certain bursts of your day. Clear inbox based on “Read” indicator My goal is to keep my inbox empty when I do a burst to work through what is sent to me. To manage what email I have processed, I simply just use the “Read” indicator on the email. I realize this is a pretty basic means of indicating if I have addressed an email, but I simply mark an email as “Unread” if I read it, and I’m not going to be able to respond to it within my burst. Therefore, it will be tagged to stay in my inbox for subsequent rules which I executed. I then have a series of rules that I trigger at the end of the burst to organize the emails into either my archive (to be referenced later) or in the trash. For example, I get a decent amount of notifications (ex. GitHub/JIRA notifications) which I do prefer to read, but I don’t plan to ever refer to them in the future, so I simply delete them if they are marked as read. Other emails that are read, I simply archive them out of my inbox. This allows me to capture the original conversation threads if I need to recall them later, but keeps it out of the inbox. Focus on minimizing what you get in your inbox I found that I didn’t like having a lot of rules organizing everything into other folders that required my routine attention. Yes, I do have still rules that organize general updates (like Google news alerts), that I will occasionally look at, and use rules to organize them from not reaching my primary inbox folder. However, I many times ended up just having more folders of content I wasn’t actually getting to, and ultimately not really consuming. By keeping the system easy on what comes into your inbox, you force yourself to be more mindful of what type of content you are subscribing into your inbox. Have a moment when your inbox is empty There is a value to having your primary inbox cleared. For a long time of my career, I didn’t value this, but often found that I would occasionally miss responding to an email or increase the daily tax on my mind on what I needed to respond to (check out Getting Things Done by David Allen for more on having a reliable way of inventorying incoming tasks). I have been using this process for several months, and it has really lowered how much context switching I was having with email, and being more productive when I focused on addressing email.
