      <description>The most valuable asset in an organization is the people. Without people, you don&amp;rsquo;t have an organization (excluding robots). In the world of software development, many forces get applied to the people within your team which harm or degrade their quality of life.</description>

      <description>Time is a one of your most valuable assets. As engineers grow with their skills and past contributions, they get invited to participate in more meetings within their day. These meetings get scheduled in time slots that show as available on their calendar, or sometimes even when they are already shown as busy - posing as a conflict.</description>

      <description>I recently built a guide on decision making, which included several different elements on how we form ideas and decisions. The purpose of this guide was to highlight common areas that typically cause strain on us humans when we are in the act of technical decision making.</description>

      <description>Last week, I had the honor of attending a preschool class to share the topic of software development. In order to explain this subject matter, I decided to prepare a few items and have them paired with a theme.</description>

      <description>Here is a short post on the importance of thanking people, and a common way I achieve this through email. This is also the final part of my trilogy on guidance with email (Email Trilogy blog series).</description>

      <description>I previously posted a short set of notes of how I apply my simple process of digesting emails. However, I think there are some other important rules of when to produce email.</description>

      <description>The pptx Language # A few months ago, I was speaking with a senior member of our engineering leadership team, and he stated that the only language he has been coding in lately, is pptx (referring to the file extension of Microsoft PowerPoint).</description>

      <description>Over the course of my engineering career, I have seen and participated in different types of team traditions. Team traditions can help build the identity or brand of a team, which is generally helpful in supporting the overall health of the team.</description>

      <description>As I talk with other engineers, I have found a common question that typically arises on &amp;ldquo;How do you make time to stay current on technology?&amp;rdquo; Other flavors of the same question are, &amp;ldquo;What podcasts do you listen to?</description>

      <description>As I have explored ways to be more productive, I generally find that everyone has a way in which they process their emails. Given that email is such a common element of communication that everyone deals with, and it has been around for a long time, there are generally several different ways of optimizing this continuous amount of content.</description>

      <description>Here are some of the guides I have built. These are intended to be concise so that they can be printed on a single page. I prefer to build these guides based on talks I have given, where they serve as basic set of notes that hopefully can further remind others of the content.</description>
