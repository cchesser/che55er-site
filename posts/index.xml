    <description><![CDATA[These last two days were KCDC in Kansas City for me. This was my first in-person developer conference since late 2019. While there were still restrictions (wearing masks), it was a fantastic time to see people again. I was able to meet up with past colleagues and discover new people at lunch and through talks, an experience that immediately filled a void in my life. While I have participated in other virtual conferences since the pandemic started, the in-person session was a great experience.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Diagraming is a powerful way of communicating ideas to others. In this past year, I have found how much I have missed the time of just working with a group and using a whiteboard to convey our ideas. In the past few months, I have referenced past diagrams or shared recent examples which included a few properties in the diagram that I believe are useful. In this short blog post, I will share some thoughts on the power of diagrams which use simple universal symbols.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Earlier this year, I shared a communication approach I was trying with my team, called a CHANGELOG. I have been applying this approach for the past six months and have learned a few lessons along the way. This post will recap some of these lessons learned, so it may better inform you the benefits and the costs of applying it.
 Improved 1:1 Conversations A primary reason why I started applying the CHANGELOG, was to simplify the routine need of communicating current topics with team members.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Two years ago, I worked on a guide that I called the Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Meetings. This guide highlighted many of the lessons I had learned over the years involving meetings at work. I have found having this guide to be a helpful reminder on things to continue to practice with the goal of optimizing time in meetings. With this year&rsquo;s change of virtual meetings being the primary means of engagement, I wanted to make an update to this guide to highlight some of these newer lessons with the virtual format.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I recently listened to a talk that reminded me of some core lessons on how we can view &ldquo;human error,&quot; and how it can help us both with our work and personal lives. From that talk, the content from The Field Guide to Understanding &lsquo;Human Error&rsquo; by Sidney Dekker is referenced. This book continues to grow as the cornerstone reference on building a safety culture. I wanted to share a short blog post as a refresher on this content, and how we can improve our systems by not looking at &ldquo;human error&rdquo; as the cause, but as the symptom of a larger problem.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction I recently tried a new experiment at work which I&rsquo;m calling &ldquo;The CHANGELOG.&rdquo; My goal with this experiment is to improve the communication within my team and with all the product groups I routinely work with. I thought it would be helpful to share some of my notes here on what and why I decided to do it.
The Name You may be wondering why I&rsquo;m calling this &ldquo;The CHANGELOG.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Time is a one of your most valuable assets. As engineers grow with their skills and past contributions, they get invited to participate in more meetings within their day. These meetings get scheduled in time slots that show as available on their calendar, or sometimes even when they are already shown as busy - posing as a conflict. This can commonly result in their day being broken down into many different meetings, with small windows of free time on their schedule.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This was my first time attending QCon, and I was really impressed with the quality of the conference. I have been a long time consumer of content on InfoQ, so it was great to be there in person and meet more practitioners that are working on interesting problems. This blog post will be a brief recap of my experience and the notes I took from the talks I attended.

    <description><![CDATA[This post is the second part of my series that breaks down my guide on decision making. I wanted to briefly share our natural tendency to favor novelty and how that can introduce challenges when assessing technology in our systems. The goal is to ensure we are aware of this attraction, understand its power to feed learning, and to make sure we balance our motivations with safe introductions of technology.]]></description>
