# Decisions: The Pursuit of Options


## The Talk

Back in June, I gave a talk at [Cerner's DevCon conference](https://engineering.cerner.com/blog/devcon-recap/) on decision making, called: _Decisions: The Pursuit of Options_. The talk has been published on YouTube for your viewing pleasure:

## The Guide

Here is the guide that I produced for this talk, which is designed for a 11x17 print-out of the notes that were covered in the slides. You can find the print-out version and references in my [_Guides_ section](/guides#decisions-the-pursuit-of-options).
